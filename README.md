### Description:
---

This is an example for a Product Landing Page for the QUADRAStalkr, an imaginary drone from an imaginary company (that I have all the rights to :smirk: :smirk: :smirk: ).  

### Project demonstrates the following:
---

- [X] **User Story #1:** My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

- [X] **User Story #2:** I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

- [X] **User Story #3:** Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

- [X] **User Story #4:** I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

- [X] **User Story #5:** When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

- [X] **User Story #6:** I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

- [X] **User Story #7:** My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

- [X] **User Story #8:** Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

- [X] **User Story #9:** The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

- [X] **User Story #10:** The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

- [X] **User Story #11:** Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

- [X] **User Story #12:** When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

- [X] **User Story #13:** The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

- [X] **User Story #14:** My product landing page should have at least one media query.

- [X] **User Story #15:** My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
