### Description:
---

This is an example for a Product Landing Page for the QUADRAStalkr, an imaginary drone from an imaginary company (that I have all the rights to :smirk: :smirk: :smirk: ).  

### Project demonstrates the following:
---

- [X] **User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

- [X] **User Story #2:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

- [X] **User Story #3:** I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

- [X] **User Story #4:** Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

- [X] **User Story #5:** Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

- [X] **User Story #6:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

- [X] **User Story #7:** I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

- [X] **User Story #8:** The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

- [X] **User Story #9:** The img element should be centered within its parent element.
