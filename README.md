### Project Description:

---

This is a passion project for me.  You can see below a description of what the new version 2.0 contains, along with a GIF of what it currently looks like.  Then step down to the next level to checkout what the version 1.0 started out as!
<br>
<br>

### New project (v2.0) demonstrates the following:
---

- [X] **User Story #1:** Content is king, and this version does a deep dive into content, bringing 1<sup>st</sup> person stories, secondary news sources, timelines, and photographs to turn an over-night, check-the-box effort into a serious journalistic endeavor.

- [X] **User Story #2:** Utilizes custom subdomain and serves it up with TSL certificate for secure https:// routing.

- [X] **User Story #3:** demonstrates IntersectionObserver API with a callback function to control animations based on screen position.

- [X] **User Story #4:** use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and to invent engaging animations which enhance UX/UI.

- [X] **User Story #5:** Adds a super slick SVG animation.

- [X] **User Story #6:** Use of JavaScript to dynamically create and place internal hyperlinks. 

- [X] **User Story #7:** Creative use of CSS to create an intriguing and visually appealing timeline effect. 

- [X] **User Story #8:** Use of flexbox to create responsive layout.

- [X] **User Story #9:** Really awesome pulsing effect.  (tip my hat off to [Florin Pop](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/03/css-pulse-effect/) for a great tutorial on how to create it.

- [X] **User Story #10:** Use of HTML/CSS to fix a known Github error that serves the page up zoomed in at 150%. 

<br>
<br>

### Original project (v1.0) demonstrated the following:
---

- [X] **User Story #1:** My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

- [X] **User Story #2:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

- [X] **User Story #3:** I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

- [X] **User Story #4:** Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

- [X] **User Story #5:** Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

- [X] **User Story #6:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

- [X] **User Story #7:** I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

- [X] **User Story #8:** The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

- [X] **User Story #9:** The img element should be centered within its parent element.
